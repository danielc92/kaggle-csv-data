<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The goal of this study was to compare the effects of four diets on the lifespan of small insects
called potato leafhoppers. One of the four was a control diet: just distilled water with no nutritive
value. Each of the other three diets had a particular sugar added to the distilled water, one of
glucose, sucrose, or fructose. Leafhoppers were sorted into groups of eight and each group was put
into one of eight lab dishes. Each of the four diets was added to two dishes, chosen using chance.
